## Introduction

Zechariah is one of the last prophets—chronologically—in the Hebrew Bible. He prophesied, along with Haggai, during the beginning of the restoration after the Jews were released from Babylonian captivity. 

The book of Zechariah consists of two parts. The first, chapters 1-8, pertain to the prophet Zechariah who was active from 520 to 518 BCE. The second part, chapter 9-14, contain two oracles, are probably from a later source, as with the book of Malachi which follows it. This separation is not unlike that of the book of Isaiah which is also divided into a portion attributed to the historical prophet Isaiah \(chapter 1-39\) and a portion attributed to later authors \(chapters 40-66\)[^1].
