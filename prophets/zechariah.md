## Introduction

Zechariah is one of the last prophets—chronologically—in the Hebrew Bible. He prophesied, along with Haggai, during the beginning of the restoration after the Jews were released from Babylonian captivity.

The book of Zechariah consists of two parts. The first, chapters 1-8, pertain to the prophet Zechariah who was active from 520 to 518 BCE. The second part, chapter 9-14, contain two oracles, are probably from a later source, as with the book of Malachi which follows it. This separation is not unlike that of the book of Isaiah which is also divided into a portion attributed to the historical prophet Isaiah \(chapter 1-39\) and a portion attributed to later authors \(chapters 40-66\)[^1]. For this weeks reading, we will focus on the portion attributed to Zechariah himself \(chapters 1-8\).

The majority of this section, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, concerns a series of eight visions. One of the things we see in the evolution of the Hebrew prophet is a developing complexity of the prophetic vision. Early on, in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) \(chapters 7-9\), we see a series of five visions. The first two are fairly straightforward, depicting destruction by locusts \(7:1-3\) and by fire \(7:4-6\). The third enters more into the realm of symbolism in which God sets "a plumb line in the midst of my people" \(7:8\). Later, Isaiah has a vision in which a seraph touches his lips with a live coal from the temple altar to purify his speech \(6:7\). Jeremiah begins with a vision of an almond tree \(1:11\) and a boiling pot \(1:13\) which both must be interpreted. But it is while the Jews are in captivity that the prophetic visions get particularly bizarre. Ezekiel's visions often contain the phrase "something like", indicating the failure of words to depict what the prophet saw in his vision. In Zechariah, one of his visions is so strange that he cannot even describe it himself. Instead, an angel describes it for him \(5:6\).
