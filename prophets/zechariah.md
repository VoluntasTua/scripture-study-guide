## Introduction

Zechariah is one of the last prophets—chronologically—in the Hebrew Bible. He prophesied, along with Haggai, during the beginning of the restoration after the Jews were released from Babylonian captivity.

The book of Zechariah consists of two parts. The first, chapters 1-8, pertain to the prophet Zechariah who was active from 520 to 518 BCE. The second part, chapter 9-14, contain two oracles, are probably from a later source, as with the book of Malachi which follows it. This separation is not unlike that of the book of Isaiah which is also divided into a portion attributed to the historical prophet Isaiah \(chapter 1-39\) and a portion attributed to later authors \(chapters 40-66\)[^1]. For this week's reading, we will focus on the portion attributed to Zechariah himself \(chapters 1-8\).

### Prologue

The prologue of Zechariah places his call in time \("in the eighth month \(_i.e._ Marheshvan\), in the second year of Darius \(_i.e._ 520 BCE\)"\) and establishes the theological and historical context. "The Lord was very angry with your ancestors . . . Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets proclaimed, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, Return from your evil ways'." It is, in short, a recap of all the we have been reading from Elijah until now concluding with, "So they repented and said, 'The Lord of hosts has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds, just as he planned to do.'"

## Visions

The majority First Zechariah, that is, chapters 1-8, consists of a series of eight visions. One of the things we see in the evolution of the Hebrew prophet is a developing complexity of the prophetic vision. Early on, in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) \(chapters 7-9\), we see a series of five visions. The first two are fairly straightforward, depicting destruction by locusts \(7.1-3\) and by fire \(7.4-6\). The third enters more into the realm of symbolism in which God sets "a plumb line in the midst of my people" \(7.8\). Later, Isaiah has a vision in which a seraph touches his lips with a live coal from the temple altar to purify his speech \(6.7\). Jeremiah begins with a vision of an almond tree \(1.11\) and a boiling pot \(1.13\) which both must be interpreted. But it is while the Jews are in captivity that the prophetic visions get particularly bizarre. Ezekiel's visions often contain the phrase "something like", indicating the failure of words to depict what the prophet saw in his vision. In Zechariah, one of his visions is so strange that he cannot even describe it himself. Instead, an angel describes it for him \(5.6\).

### The First Vision: Divine Horses Patrol the Earth

Three months after his call, Zechariah has his first vision. It is unclear whether all of the visions happen in a single night \(as some suppose\) or whether they are spaced out over the following two years. It begins with the appearance of four horses. For many of us, this immediately brings to mind the four horsemen of the apocalypse described in the New Testament Revelation to John chapter 6. While the appearance of the four horsemen in John's Apocalypse may well be an allusion to the four horses found in Zechariah's first vision, they are not the same. John's horses are white, red, black, and pale and have symbolic meanings associated with them. The horses in Zechariah's vision share only three colors \(red is repeated\) and no symbolic interpretation is given. Tiemeyer \(2016a\) describes three lines of thought regarding these colors: One is that they are insignificant. The words used to describe the horses should not be translated into primary colors but are rather natural "horse colors". Two, they are symbolic. Citing Delkurt, the notion here is that there is nothing superfluous in Zechariah's vision report and so they must mean something. Third is to leave it as an authentic visionary experience and arguably an unnatural one \(_i.e._ the color "red" \(אָדֹ֔ם\) is to be interpreted not as "chestnut", as some would have it, but actually red like blood\).[^2] It's worth nothing that the word translated here as "red" is used elsewhere "to describe blood \(2 Kgs. 3:22\), grape juice \(Isa 63:2\), lentil stew \(Gen. 25:30; cf. 25:34\), a cow \(Num. 19:2\), and human skin \(Song. 5:10\)."[^3] My own interpretation lies somewhere between these. Like the third interpretation, I think we should take these visions as authentic experiences. As such, they could contain symbolic value that may not even have been understood by the prophet himself. Whether the colors are meant to depict natural horse colors or not is probably impossible to discern in any definitive sense. If there is an interpretation that works for you, then that is an authentic interpretation. But it is probably foolhardy to attempt to find a single "correct" interpretation. And it is equally likely that Zechariah merely reported the colors of the horses as he saw them \(they had to be _some_ color\) and faithfully reported them though they have no meaning whatsoever.

The number four, however, is most certainly symbolic. We see the number four over and over again with regard to the four cardinal directions and though this passage does not reference those directions _per se_, it seems likely that that is what is symbolized here by the number four as encompassing the whole Earth.

### The Second Vision: Four Horns and Four Craftsmen

![](/assets/Weigel_Four_horns_and_craftsmen.jpg)

Unlike the first vision, this second vision has no movement but instead consists of two static images, one replacing the other. Tiemeyer \(2016\) compares this to the visions we see in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) 8:1-2 and [Jeremiah](/prophets/jeremiah-.md) \(1:11-12\). But there is an important difference between this vision and the one we read in Amos. Amos's visions contain a sort of word play in which the words used to describe the visions are phonetically and orthographically connected to that which they symbolize. In Zechariah' visions, in contrast, that is not the case. So we see here a symbolism that has shifted from the aural to the visual. As for the horns themselves, there is little consensus. It could be for detached animal horns, as depicted in Christoph Weigel's engraving above, or the four corners of a stone altar. Given that the explanation given for the horns is that they "have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem," the two possible interpretations would seem to make a very big difference. If the horns are animal horns, or perhaps horns on a helmet as some suggest, then the connection to violence is self-evident. But if it represents the four corners of an altar, then the interpretation is not nearly so straightforward. Looking back on the prophets referred to in the prologue, it is clear that a central reason for God having caused the those nations to scatter Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem is due to their having violated their covenant with God. So such a theological interpretation almost seems plausible. But as it is, that interpretation seems unlikely.

### The Third Vision: A Surveyor Measures Jerusalem

This vision is remarkably complex given it's brevity. In only five verses, it tells of three or four persons, including the prophet. First a man appears with a measuring line. This itself is significant. When Zechariah asks where he is going, he says "to measure Jerusalem." The next verse refers to "the angel who talked with me". It is not clear if this is the man with the measuring line or if this is the explaining angel in the previous vision. Then another angel appears \(this being either the third or forth entity depending on how we interpret the previous verse\) who says to that angel, "say to that young man: Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls," and so on. It seems as though this second angel is speaking about Zechariah and he is merely witnessing this exchange. Tiemeyer takes verse 1:16 to be an interpretation of the measuring line in this third vision which, while confusing \(due to its ordering\) does make sense.

The final two verses seem to allude to a prophesy that Jerusalem with grow quickly.

The rest of Chapter 2 consists of admonitions and promises. The poet David Rosenberg, in his book, _A Literary Bible_, translates it thus:

> Sing like a skylark  
> happy being home  
> daughter of Zion
>
> because I am coming  
> to join you  
> with the sky you hoped for
>
> over you  
> sky of your deepest dream  
> infinite sky
>
> of reality  
> you dared to see  
> in the midst of a fogbound world
>
> I will be in the midst of you  
> as true as your eyes  
> see through a clear blue sky
>
> and I will be inside of you  
> as you were open to me          light  
> in a world suppressed in darkness
>
> leadenly earthbound  
> giants in their mirror  
> hearing only themselves
>
> and the gargoyles of their unconscious  
> but light is the voice of your creator  
> breaking through you
>
> in the midst of the world  
> and many nations will see it  
> dawn breaking on that day
>
> all will join me in the light  
> of reality          warm  
> beneath an infinite wing
>
> and you will know my breath is sent  
> the man who is speaking to you  
> by the Lord our creator
>
> who will breathe in Israel  
> once again enfolding his daughter  
> Zion in the holy land
>
> holding Jerusalem  
> small reflection  
> in the pupil of an eye
>
> beholding him again  
> beneath an azure sky  
> calm inside
>
> be quiet be still  
> all people of flesh  
> before the Lord
>
> a sky of promise is unfolding  
> before us  
> the horizon expands
>
> to include earth and sky  
> and the small voice within  
> will break out singing.

### The Fourth Vision: Joshua and the Satan

It's worth nothing that here \(as in the Qur'an\), "satan" is an improper noun, meaning accuser or adversary, as opposed to a proper noun, _i.e._ the name of the Devil or a synonym for Lucifer, as is commonly understood in English. Throughout the Hebrew Bible as well as in the Qur'an, we see depictions or allusions to a sort of divine courtroom. Often, as in this case, the satan takes the role of prosecuting attorney \(with the defendant frequently humanity itself\). The vision in chapter three is less formal than some other depictions but still carries this connotation.

Joshua is the high priest at the time. The appearance of a cult leader in a prophetic vision is likely to be significant no matter what, but at this time, historically, it is particularly significant. The Jews are still resettling Jerusalem and the temple is still being rebuilt. \(It won't be completed until 515 BCE, a few years after this vision most likely occurred.\) Since the destruction of the temple, the theology of the Jewish people has had to undergo a dramatic shift. Ezekiel's visions depict the presence of God literally leaving the temple before it is destroyed. Jeremiah described a new covenant with the _Torah_ written on the very hearts of the people thus obviating the need for a priesthood. Now that the Jews are resettling Jerusalem, the temple is being rebuilt, and the priesthood is resuming its former duties as intermediary between God and the people. The satan accuses Joshua of being unclean but the angel comes to his defense and clothes him in clean apparel. There are many ways one could interpret this. One might be: though the priesthood has been sullied, it still provides an essential function, so we must pick it up, clean it up, and return it to its rightful place, all the while not forgetting how it became sullied in the first place.

### The Fifth Vision: A Menorah and Two Olive Trees

Whereas chapter 3 concerned the priest, Joshua, chapter 4 concerns the governor Zerubbabel. As with other prophecies, it describes how a political figure acts as an agent of God.

One of the most ambiguous parts of this vision comes at the end \(4:10b-14\). Here is Petterson's \(2009\) translation:

> These seven are the eyes of Yahweh that roam through the whole earth. I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the menorah and on its left?" A second time I answered and said to him, "What are these two streams of the olive trees, which through two golden pipes are pouring out from them the gold\[en oil\]?" He said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my Lord." He said, "These are the two sons of oil who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."[^4]

One thing you may notice if you compare this to many other translations of בְנֵֽי־ הַיִּצְהָ֑ר, you'll notice that it is frequently translated as "anointed ones". Peterson echoes Rose \(2000\) in saying this translation is flawed.[^5] Rather they argue that what is meant by בְנֵֽי־ הַיִּצְהָ֑ר, or, literally, "sons of oil", is that they \(like the two olive trees in the vision\) are _sources_ of "oil", rather than recipients of it.

The next question is: who are these sons of oil? Three possibilities are given: Joshua and Zerubbabel, Zechariah and Haggai, or two heavenly beings, unnamed. Each of these interpretations carry its own connotations and each has its own arguments for and against. I leave it to you to find an interpretation that works for you, understanding that your interpretation is but one of many possible.

### The Sixth Vision: A Flying Scroll

Chapter five contains the sixth and seventh visions in the sequence. Though they are distinct, they are considered more related to one another and are often interpreted together.

The first vision consists of a flying scroll. The footnote to this vision in the New Oxford Annotated Bible observes this scroll is "long, almost 30 ft \(9 m\). This scroll has a proportion of 2:1, more like a carpet than a document; the [Qumran Isaiah scroll](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah) is about 24 ft \(7.3 m\) long and 11 in \(30 cm\) wide, a proportion of 24:1.3."[^6] It is also worth noting that this scroll, like the one in Ezekiel 2:10, has writing on both sides. This would have been unusual.

![](/assets/Seleznikha_church_-_prophet_Zechariah_%2818_c.%29.jpg)

The two sides refer to two of the ten commandments given in [Exodus](/torah/exodus.md) 20. The implication would seem to be that these two commandments \(at least\) are now to be understood as applying universally, unlike the 613 commandments that apply to the Jewish people _per se_.

### The Seventh Vision: A Woman in a Basket

The transition to the seventh vision is strangely abrupt. "Then the angel who talked with me came forward" implies that the angel had been away for a time. Both of the visions in chapter five involve flying objects \(scroll and basket\) as a means of purging "undesirable elements \(thieves, perjurers, and idolatry\)".[^7]

It is worth noting that the "basket", or אֵיפָ֔ה, in this vision could not possibly hold a human being. The impossibility of this image might be why Zechariah was unable to describe it himself but required the explaining angel to do so.

### The Eighth Vision: Four Chariots

![](/assets/Gustave_Doré_%281832-1883%29_-_The_Bible_%281865%29_-_Zechariah_6-5.jpg)

Zechariah's last vision, like his first, centers on the appearance of horses. However, this time, the vision is greatly evolved. The horses now draw chariots. One may interpret from this—if one adopts a military metaphor—a shift from reconnaissance to a more aggressive and interventionist stance. This vision also has a far more apocalyptic flavor to it. In the first vision, we compared the horses to those found in the Revelation to John. In this vision, the parallels are a lot clearer. For one thing, the colors of the horses have changed. Before there were three colors for four horses. This time, there are four colors and they are assigned to all the horses for each chariot respectively, suggesting something far less random. Also, though the colors are not interpreted in this case, they come closer to the colors in Revelation. It is difficult to interpret color words across language and centuries. We saw the ambiguity of the color אָדֹ֔ם \(frequently translated as "red"\) for instance. So it is difficult to know if אָדֹ֔ם in this context is equivalent to πυρρός in the Revelation of John written some 600 years later. But it is interesting that three of the four colors do seem equivalent.

אָדֹ֔ם = red = πυρρός  
לְבָנִ֑ים = white = λευκός  
שְׁחֹרִֽים = black = μέλας

The last seems ambiguous. אֲמֻצִּֽים בְּרֻדִּ֖ים is translated as "strong spotted" or "dappled gray" while χλωρός is translated as "pale" or "green". Should the incomplete symmetry bar us from regarding John's horses as the same as Zechariah's? To make matters worse, in the second account of the four sets of horses, \(Zech 6:6-7\) the "red" horses are dropped and "strong" and "spotted" appear as two different sets. It strikes me that since the chariots are given different assignments based on the color of their horses, the color is significant \(unlike in 1:8 where it seemed comparatively more arbitrary\).

## Interpretations and Oracles

### Interpretation of Zechariah's Eighth Vision: Wealth and Coronation

As with the third vision in chapter 2, the eighth vision in chapter 6 includes an appendix. What is surprising about this passage is that it instructs Zechariah to crown Joshua, the high priest, and not Zerubbabel, the governor and arguably the rightful king. Some \(Peterson, 2009\) have suggested that this passage originally referred to Zerubbabel but that since he failed to restore the monarchy, the name was subsequently changed to Joshua by later editors. Attempting to reconstruct the "original" text in this fashion seems dangerous to say the least, but this interpretation would seem quite logical under the circumstances.

As stated above, it is unknown whether these eight visions occurred in a single night \(as some suppose\) or whether they were spaced out over the course of two years. My own opinion is that the latter makes more sense, as the visions seem to reflect a developing story in the life of the people resettling Jerusalem. The sixth and seventh vision seem to go together. Likewise, the fourth and fifth vision make a handy pair as they regard two of Zechariah's contemporaries.

### Historical Reprise

Chapter 7 brings the attention back to historical matters, much like the opening of chapter 1 did. It is now two years after Zechariah's initial call. This chapter concludes with an oracle that could be taken as a summary of the message of all of the Hebrew Prophets or even the Hebrew Bible as a whole:

> Thus says the Lord of hosts: Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another;  
> do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the alien, or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.  
> But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears in order not to hear.  
> They made their hearts adamant in order not to hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the Lord of hosts.  
> Just as, when I called, they would not hear, so, when they called, I would not hear, says the Lord of hosts,  
> and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and a pleasant land was made desolate.

### Ten Oracles of Restoration

First Zechariah concludes with ten oracles of the new Jerusalem that is to be built. This is reminiscent of the visions of pre-exilic prophets who predicted the destruction of Judah but also envisioned its restoration such as in Isaiah 2 and Micah 4:

> In days to come  
>     the mountain of the Lord’s house  
> shall be established as the highest of the mountains,  
>     and shall be raised above the hills;  
> all the nations shall stream to it.
>
> Many peoples shall come and say,  
> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,  
>     to the house of the God of Jacob;  
> that he may teach us his ways  
>     and that we may walk in his paths.”  
> For out of Zion shall go forth instruction,  
>     and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
>
> He shall judge between the nations,  
>     and shall arbitrate for many peoples;  
> they shall beat their swords into plowshares,  
>     and their spears into pruning hooks;  
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation,  
>     neither shall they learn war any more.

While Isaiah and Micah and Zechariah and others most likely took this revelation in a most literal sense, it continues to be valuable to us today, not so much as a plan for the physical city of Jerusalem in the Middle East but as a hope for a future world. Walter Brueggemann \(1988\) believes that this sort of "prophetic imagination" is precisely what we need and that, indeed, it is helpful to think of ourselves as being in exile from this state of being. He writes, "the problem of our time is not atheism but idolatry."[^8] And indeed, if we look at what God requires of us in the previous chapter, to "render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another, do not oppress the widow, the orphan, the alien, or the poor, and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another," are these words any less relevant today than they were 2500 years ago?

## Conclusion

Prophetic literature is a genre to itself. It is both extremely timely \(notice the historical references throughout\) and timeless \(the problems the prophets address are no less relevant today than they were 2500-3000 years ago. This form of revelation plays a central role in all three of the Abrahamic religions, from Judaism to Christianity to Islam.
