## Introduction

Zechariah is one of the last prophets—chronologically—in the Hebrew Bible. He prophesied, along with Haggai, during the beginning of the restoration after the Jews were released from Babylonian captivity.

The book of Zechariah consists of two parts. The first, chapters 1-8, pertain to the prophet Zechariah who was active from 520 to 518 BCE. The second part, chapter 9-14, contain two oracles, are probably from a later source, as with the book of Malachi which follows it. This separation is not unlike that of the book of Isaiah which is also divided into a portion attributed to the historical prophet Isaiah \(chapter 1-39\) and a portion attributed to later authors \(chapters 40-66\)[^1]. For this week's reading, we will focus on the portion attributed to Zechariah himself \(chapters 1-8\).

### Prologue

The prologue of Zechariah places his call in time \("in the eighth month \(_i.e._ Marheshvan\), in the second year of Darius \(_i.e._ 520 BCE\)"\) and establishes the theological and historical context. "The Lord was very angry with your ancestors . . . Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets proclaimed, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, Return from your evil ways'." It is, in short, a recap of all the we have been reading from Elijah until now concluding with, "So they repented and said, 'The Lord of hosts has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds, just as he planned to do.'"

## Visions

The majority First Zechariah, that is, chapters 1-8, consists of a series of eight visions. One of the things we see in the evolution of the Hebrew prophet is a developing complexity of the prophetic vision. Early on, in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) \(chapters 7-9\), we see a series of five visions. The first two are fairly straightforward, depicting destruction by locusts \(7.1-3\) and by fire \(7.4-6\). The third enters more into the realm of symbolism in which God sets "a plumb line in the midst of my people" \(7.8\). Later, Isaiah has a vision in which a seraph touches his lips with a live coal from the temple altar to purify his speech \(6.7\). Jeremiah begins with a vision of an almond tree \(1.11\) and a boiling pot \(1.13\) which both must be interpreted. But it is while the Jews are in captivity that the prophetic visions get particularly bizarre. Ezekiel's visions often contain the phrase "something like", indicating the failure of words to depict what the prophet saw in his vision. In Zechariah, one of his visions is so strange that he cannot even describe it himself. Instead, an angel describes it for him \(5.6\).

### The First Vision: Divine Horses Patrol the Earth

Three months after his call, Zechariah has his first vision. It is unclear whether all of the visions happen in a single night \(as some suppose\) or whether they are spaced out over the following two years. It begins with the appearance of four horses. For many of us, this immediately brings to mind the four horsemen of the apocalypse described in the New Testament Revelation to John chapter 6. While the appearance of the four horsemen in John's Apocalypse may well be an allusion to the four horses found in Zechariah's first vision, they are not the same. John's horses are white, red, black, and pale and have symbolic meanings associated with them. The horses in Zechariah's vision share only three colors \(red is repeated\) and no symbolic interpretation is given. Tiemeyer \(2016\) describes three lines of thought regarding these colors: One is that they are insignificant. The words used to describe the horses should not be translated into primary colors but are rather natural "horse colors". Two, they are symbolic. Citing Delkurt, the notion here is that there is nothing superfluous in Zechariah's vision report and so they must mean something. Third is to leave it as an authentic visionary experience and arguably an unnatural one \(_i.e._ the color "red" is to be interpreted not as "chestnut", as some would have it, but actually red like blood\).[^2] It's worth nothing that the word translated here as "red" is used elsewhere "to describe blood \(2 Kgs. 3:22\), grape juice \(Isa 63:2\), lentil stew \(Gen. 25:30; cf. 25:34\), a cow \(Num. 19:2\), and human skin \(Song. 5:10\)."[^3] My own interpretation lies somewhere between these. Like the third interpretation, I think we should take these visions as authentic experiences. As such, they could contain symbolic value that may not even have been understood by the prophet himself. Whether the colors are meant to depict natural horse colors or not is probably impossible to discern in any definitive sense. If there is an interpretation that works for you, then that is an authentic interpretation. But it is probably foolhardy to attempt to find a single "correct" interpretation. And it is equally likely that Zechariah merely reported the colors of the horses as he saw them \(they had to be _some_ color\) and faithfully reported them though they have no meaning whatsoever.

The number four, however, is most certainly symbolic. We see the number four over and over again with regard to the four cardinal directions and though this passage does not reference those directions _per se_, it seems likely that that is what is symbolized here by the number four as encompassing the whole Earth.

### The Second Vision: Four Horns and Four Craftsmen

![](/assets/Weigel_Four_horns_and_craftsmen.jpg)

Unlike the first vision, this second vision has no movement but instead consists of two static images, one replacing the other. Tiemeyer \(2016\) compares this to the visions we see in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) 8:1-2 and [Jeremiah](/prophets/jeremiah-.md) \(1:11-12\). But there is an important difference between this vision and the one we read in Amos. Amos's visions contain a sort of word play in which the words used to describe the visions are phonetically and orthographically connected to that which they symbolize. In Zechariah' visions, in contrast, that is not the case. So we see here a symbolism that has shifted from the aural to the visual. As for the horns themselves, there is little consensus. It could be for detached animal horns, as depicted in Christoph Weigel's engraving above, or the four corners of a stone altar. Given that the explanation given for the horns is that they "have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem," the two possible interpretations would seem to make a very big difference. If the horns are animal horns, or perhaps horns on a helmet as some suggest, then the connection to violence is self-evident. But if it represents the four corners of an altar, then the interpretation is not nearly so straightforward. Looking back on the prophets referred to in the prologue, it is clear that a central reason for God having caused the those nations to scatter Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem is due to their having violated their covenant with God. So such a theological interpretation almost seems plausible. But as it is, that interpretation seems unlikely.

### The Third Vision: A Surveyor Measures Jerusalem

This vision is remarkably complex given it's brevity. In only five verses, it tells of three or four persons, including the prophet. First a man appears with a measuring line. This itself is significant. When Zechariah asks where he is going, he says "to measure Jerusalem." The next verse refers to "the angel who talked with me". It is not clear if this is the man with the measuring line or if this is the explaining angel in the previous vision. Then another angel appears \(this being either the third or forth entity depending on how we interpret the previous verse\) who says to that angel, "say to that young man: Jerusalem shall be inhabited like villages without walls," and so on. It seems as though this second angel is speaking about Zechariah and he is merely witnessing this exchange. Tiemeyer takes verse 1:16 to be an interpretation of the measuring line in this third vision which, while confusing \(due to its ordering\) does make sense.

The final two verses seem to allude to a prophesy that Jerusalem with grow quickly.

The rest of Chapter 2 consists of admonitions and promises. The poet David Rosenberg, in his book, _A Literary Bible_, translates it thus:

> Sing like a skylark  
> happy being home  
> daughter of Zion
>
> because I am coming  
> to join you  
> with the sky you hoped for
>
> over you  
> sky of your deepest dream  
> infinite sky
>
> of reality  
> you dared to see  
> in the midst of a fogbound world
>
> I will be in the midst of you  
> as true as your eyes  
> see through a clear blue sky
>
> and I will be inside of you  
> as you were open to me          light  
> in a world suppressed in darkness
>
> leadenly earthbound  
> giants in their mirror  
> hearing only themselves
>
> and the gargoyles of their unconscious  
> but light is the voice of your creator  
> breaking through you
>
> in the midst of the world  
> and many nations will see it  
> dawn breaking on that day
>
> all will join me in the light  
> of reality          warm  
> beneath an infinite wing
>
> and you will know my breath is sent  
> the man who is speaking to you  
> by the Lord our creator
>
> who will breathe in Israel  
> once again enfolding his daughter  
> Zion in the holy land
>
> holding Jerusalem  
> small reflection  
> in the pupil of an eye
>
> beholding him again  
> beneath an azure sky  
> calm inside
>
> be quiet be still  
> all people of flesh  
> before the Lord
>
> a sky of promise is unfolding  
> before us  
> the horizon expands
>
> to include earth and sky  
> and the small voice within  
> will break out singing.

### The Fourth Vision: Joshua and the Satan

It's worth nothing that here \(as in the Qur'an\), "satan" is an improper noun, meaning accuser or adversary, as opposed to a proper noun, _i.e._ the name of the Devil or a synonym for Lucifer, as is commonly understood in English. Throughout the Hebrew Bible as well as in the Qur'an, we see depictions or allusions to a sort of divine courtroom. Often, as in this case, the satan takes the role of prosecuting attorney \(with the defendant frequently humanity itself\). The vision in chapter three is less formal than some other depictions but still carries this connotation.

Joshua is the high priest at the time. The appearance of a cult leader in a prophetic vision is likely to be significant no matter what, but at this time, historically, it is particularly significant. The Jews are still resettling Jerusalem and the temple is still being rebuilt. \(It won't be completed until 515 BCE, a few years after this vision most likely occurred.\) Since the destruction of the temple, the theology of the Jewish people has had to undergo a dramatic shift. Ezekiel's visions depict the presence of God literally leaving the temple before it is destroyed. Jeremiah described a new covenant with the _Torah_ written on the very hearts of the people thus obviating the need for a priesthood. Now that the Jews are resettling Jerusalem, the temple is being rebuilt, and the priesthood is resuming its former duties as intermediary between God and the people. The satan accuses Joshua of being unclean but the angel comes to his defense and clothes him in clean apparel. There are many ways one could interpret this. One might be: though the priesthood has been sullied, it still provides an essential function, so we must pick it up, clean it up, and return it to its rightful place, all the while not forgetting how it became sullied in the first place.

### The Fifth Vision: A Menorah and Two Olive Trees

Whereas chapter 3 concerned the priest, Joshua, chapter 4 concerns the governor Zerubbabel. As with other prophecies, it describes how a political figure acts as an agent of God. 

One of the most ambiguous parts of this vision comes at the end \(4:10b-14\). Here is Petterson's \(2009\) translation:

> These seven are the eyes of Yahweh that roam through the whole earth. I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the menorah and on its left?" A second time I answered and said to him, "What are these two streams of the olive trees, which through two golden pipes are pouring out from them the gold\[en oil\]?" He said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my Lord." He said, "These are the two sons of oil who stand by the Lord of the whole earth."[^4]

One thing you may notice if you compare this to many other translations of בְנֵֽי־ הַיִּצְהָ֑ר, you'll notice that it is frequently translated as "anointed ones". Peterson echoes Rose \(2000\) in saying this translation is flawed.[^5] Rather they argue that what is meant by בְנֵֽי־ הַיִּצְהָ֑ר, or, literally, "sons of oil", is that they \(like the two olive trees in the vision\) are _sources_ of "oil", rather than recipients of it.

The next question is: who are these sons of oil? Three possibilities are given: Joshua and Zerubbabel, Zechariah and Haggai
