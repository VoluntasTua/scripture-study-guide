## Introduction

Zechariah is one of the last prophets—chronologically—in the Hebrew Bible. He prophesied, along with Haggai, during the beginning of the restoration after the Jews were released from Babylonian captivity.

The book of Zechariah consists of two parts. The first, chapters 1-8, pertain to the prophet Zechariah who was active from 520 to 518 BCE. The second part, chapter 9-14, contain two oracles, are probably from a later source, as with the book of Malachi which follows it. This separation is not unlike that of the book of Isaiah which is also divided into a portion attributed to the historical prophet Isaiah \(chapter 1-39\) and a portion attributed to later authors \(chapters 40-66\)[^1]. For this week's reading, we will focus on the portion attributed to Zechariah himself \(chapters 1-8\).

### Prologue

The prologue of Zechariah places his call in time \("in the eighth month \(_i.e._ Marheshvan\), in the second year of Darius \(_i.e._ 520 BCE\)"\) and establishes the theological and historical context. "The Lord was very angry with your ancestors . . . Thus says the Lord of hosts: return to me . . . Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets proclaimed, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, Return from your evil ways . . .'." It is, in short, a recap of all the we have been reading from Elijah until now concluding with, "So they repented and said, 'The Lord of hosts has dealt with us according to our ways and deeds, just as he planned to do.'"

## Visions

The majority First Zechariah, that is, chapters 1-8, consists of a series of eight visions. One of the things we see in the evolution of the Hebrew prophet is a developing complexity of the prophetic vision. Early on, in [Amos](/prophets/amos.md) \(chapters 7-9\), we see a series of five visions. The first two are fairly straightforward, depicting destruction by locusts \(7.1-3\) and by fire \(7.4-6\). The third enters more into the realm of symbolism in which God sets "a plumb line in the midst of my people" \(7.8\). Later, Isaiah has a vision in which a seraph touches his lips with a live coal from the temple altar to purify his speech \(6.7\). Jeremiah begins with a vision of an almond tree \(1.11\) and a boiling pot \(1.13\) which both must be interpreted. But it is while the Jews are in captivity that the prophetic visions get particularly bizarre. Ezekiel's visions often contain the phrase "something like", indicating the failure of words to depict what the prophet saw in his vision. In Zechariah, one of his visions is so strange that he cannot even describe it himself. Instead, an angel describes it for him \(5.6\).

### The First Vision: Divine Horsemen Patrol the Earth

Three months after his call, Zechariah has his first vision. It is unclear whether all of the visions happen in a single night \(as some suppose\) or whether they are spaced out over the following two years. It begins with the appearance of four horses. For many of us, this immediately brings to mind the four horsemen of the apocalypse described in the New Testament Revelation to John chapter 6. While the appearance of the four horsemen in John's Apocalypse may well be an allusion to the four horses found in Zechariah's first vision, they are not the same. John's horses are white, red, black, and pale and have symbolic meanings associated with them. The horses in Zechariah's vision share only three colors \(red is repeated\) and no symbolic interpretation is given. Tiemeyer \(2016\) describes three lines of thought regarding these colors: One is that they are insignificant. The words used to describe the horses should not be translated into primary colors but are rather natural "horse colors". Two, they are symbolic. Citing Delkurt, the notion here is that there is nothing superfluous in Zechariah's vision report and so they must mean something. Third is to leave it as an authentic visionary experience and arguably an unnatural one \(_i.e._ the color "red" is to be interpreted not as "chestnut", as some would have it, but actually red like blood\).[^2] It's worth nothing that the word translated here as "red" is used elsewhere "to describe blood \(2 Kgs. 3:22\), grape juice \(Isa 63:2\), lentil stew \(Gen. 25:30; cf. 25:34\), a cow \(Num. 19:2\), and human skin \(Song. 5:10\)."[^3] My own interpretation lies somewhere between these. Like the third interpretation, I think we should take these visions as authentic experiences. As such, they could contain symbolic value that may not even have been understood by the prophet himself. Whether the colors are meant to depict natural horse colors or not is probably impossible to discern in any definitive sense. If there is an interpretation that works for you, then that is an authentic interpretation. But it is probably foolhardy to attempt to find a single "correct" interpretation. And it is equally likely that Zechariah merely reported the colors of the horses as he saw them \(they had to be _some_ color\) and faithfully reported them though they have no meaning whatsoever.

The number four, however, is most certainly symbolic. We see the number four over and over again with regard to the four cardinal directions and though this passage does not reference those directions _per se_, it seems likely that that is what is symbolized here by the number four as encompassing the whole Earth.
