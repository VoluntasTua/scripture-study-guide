# The Prohets

The prophetic tradition is one of the most distinctive features of the Abrahamic tradition. That tradition includes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. While many \(most?\) religions include a dimension that could be interpreted as "prophetic"[^1], prophesy plays a special role in the Abrahamic religions quite unlike what we find in other scripture-based religions \(such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism\). In the Jewish cannon, we find these texts collected in the second of three books that make up the Tanakh, namely the Nevi'im, or literally "Prophets". In the Christian Old Testament, these writings are spread across the Historical Books \(specifically Kings\), the Major Prophets \(specifically Jeremiah\), and the Twelve Minor Prophets \(specifically Amos and Zechariah\). 

We will cover these in chronological order beginning with Elijah in the 9th Century B.C.E. We will then move on to Amos in the 8th Century. Both of these prophets were active in the northern kingdom of Israel before it fell in 722 B.C.E. We will then consider selections from Jeremiah who was active in the southern kingdom of Judah during the fall of Jerusalem  in 587 B.C.E. Finally, we will read Zechariah who was active during the resettlement of Jerusalem around 520-518 B.C.E. 

All of these prophets were active after the division of kingdom following the death of Solomon in 922 B.C.E. From Amos to Zechariah, we see the gradual fall, first of the Israel, then of Judah, and finally the restoration of Jerusalem at the turn of the 5th century B.C.E.
