# The Prohets

The prophetic tradition is one of the most distinctive features of the Abrahamic tradition. That tradition includes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. While many \(most?\) religions include a dimension that could be interpreted as "prophetic"[^1], prophesy plays a special role in the Abrahamic religions quite unlike what we find in other scripture-based religions \(such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism\). In the Jewish cannon, we find these texts collected in the second of three books that make up the Tanakh, namely the Nevi'im, or literally "Prophets"
