## Ayah

Ayah \(ayat, _pl_.\) translates as "verse". It literally means "sign". A sura consists of anywhere from 3 to 286 ayat.

## Babylonian captivity

In 605 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, invaded the southern kingdom of Judah. The northern kingdom of Israel had already fallen some 117 years earlier. The first deportation occurred in 597 BCE followed by a second, ten years later, when the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed. This captivity lasted until 539 BCE when the Persian king, Cyrus, conquered Babylon and permitted Babylonian captives (including the Jews) to return to their native lands. Some say that it was only with the resettlement of Jerusalem by the Babylonian captives that the Jews as a people are first defined.

## Deutero-Isaiah

The book of Isaiah \(located among the Prophets of the Hebrew Bible\) is divided into three parts. The first part \(chapters 1-39\) regard the original prophet Isaiah from around the turn of the 7th century B.C.E. The second part \(chapters 40-55\) concern a different anonymous prophet some generations later during the exilic period. Internal evidence attests to authorship separated in time though the text itself is undivided. The second \(anonymous\) prophet is traditionally referred to as "Deutero-Isaiah" or sometimes "2 Isaiah" to distinguish him or her from the original Isaiah. The last section \(chapters 56-66\), sometimes referred to as "Trito-Isaiah" is an anthology of short works.

## Hijra

The migration of Muhammed and his followers from Mecca to Yathrib \(later renamed by him to Medina\) in 622 C.E. This marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

## Juz

Besides the 114 suras \(or "enclosures"\), the Qur'an can also be divided into 30 roughly equal parts, or _juz_. The last such part, _Juz Amma_ contains the last 37 suras of the Quran. These are also the shortest suras, and almost all from the early Meccan period \(with the exception of 98 and 110 which are considered to be Medinan\). Muslims will typically start their study of the Qur'an with _Juz Amma_, often memorizing it in its entirety.

## Muqaṭṭaʿāt

29 of the 114 suras of the Qur'an begin with one or more disconnected letters. The meaning of these letters is not definitively known though there are many interpretations. Four of these suras are named after these letters: _Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ_ \(20\), [_Yāʾ-Sīn_ \(36\)](/quran/week-4-suras-36-67-32/sura-36.md), [_Ṣād_ \(38\)](/quran/week-3-suras-19-38/sura-38.md) and _Qāf_ \(50\).

## Sura

Sura \(also sometimes transliterated as _surah_\) translates as "chapter". It literally means "enclosure". There are 114 of them in the Qur'an.

## Tanakh

Commonly referred to as the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh contains three parts: the _Torah_ \(Law\), the _Nevi'im_ \(Prophets\), and the _Ketuvim_ \(Writings\). _Tanakh_ is a Hebrew acronym of these three. The Tanakh contains the same texts as the Protestant Old Testament, though it is divided differently. In all versions of the Bible, the first collection is the Torah or Pentateuch \(literally meaning "Five Books" referring to the five books of Moses\): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The Protestant Old Testament then proceeds with the Historical Books, some of which are included in the Hebrew _Nevi'im_ and some in the _Ketuvim_. Then follows the Wisdom books, which are entirely included in the Hebrew _Ketuvim_. Then the Major Prophets, some of which, again, are in the _Nevi'im_, and some in the _Ketuvim_. And finally the 12 Minor Prophets, all of which appear in the _Nevi'im_. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox versions of the Old Testament include all of these books and several more. For our purposes, we will be using the Hebrew division for convenience. So we will devote one month to the Torah/Pentateuch, one month to the Prophets \(including portions from the Historical Books, and both the Major and Minor Prophets\), and one month for the _Ketuvim_, focusing specifically on the Wisdom books, especially the three Poetic books: Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.

## Theodicy

The vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. This is a common theme among the prophets of the Abrahamic tradition from Jeremiah at the start of the Babylonian Exile \(6th Century B.C.E\) all the way through to Muhammad and the Hijra \(7th Century C.E.\) as well as among many Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians up through the present day.
