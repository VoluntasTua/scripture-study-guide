Some background: the 114 chapters, or suras (literally, "enclosures") of the Qur'an were received over the course of 23 years. The majority of the suras (by count) were received in the first 13 years when the Prophet Mohammed was still living in Mecca. They tend to be shorter and more poetic. In 622 CE, it became too dangerous for Mohammed and his community of Muslims to stay in Mecca (I guess telling everyone they were going to hell all the time didn't go over well) so they emigrated to Yathrib, later known as Medina. This is known as the Hijra and is the beginning of the Muslim calendar. the last 24 suras were received after this emigration. They tend to be much longer and focus more on legal and social matters as Mohammed was establishing political and military control of the area. Though they are only two dozen of them, they account for nearly half of the total volume.
