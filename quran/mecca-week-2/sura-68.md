# Introduction {#introduction}

1.  Chronology:
    1.  Egyptian 2
    2.  Nöldeke 18 (First Meccan Period)
2.  Letters: ن (Nūn)
3.  The Structure of the Sura: 16, 18, 18
    1.  1 – 16
    2.  17 – 34
    3.  35 – 52
4.  Jewels of Divine Knowledge: _None_
5.  Pearls of Wisdom: _None_

Sura 68, known as _al-Qalam_, translated as the Pen, takes its name from the first ayah. It is one of the earliest suras. Some consider it to be the second sura received after 96 (widely considered to be the first sura). Nöldeke places it a bit later, but still clearly in the earliest Meccan period. Javed Ahmed Ghamidi posits that, in spite of the fact that they were composed at different times, suras 67 and 68 compose a unit concerning “يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ”, the Day of Judgment or Resurrection. He argues, “Just as in the previous sūrah the Quraysh are warned of the punishment of the Day of Judgement and of the punishment which they will face in this world if they deny the punishment of the Day of Judgement, similar is the warning sounded in this sūrah. However, this sūrah is more stern in its tone.”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-4"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup> Perhaps it is not surprising that in a sura with this “more stern” tone, Al-Ghazzali did not find any jewels or pearls.

# Part I: To the Prophets<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-5"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-5">[5]</a></sup></sup> {#part-i-to-the-prophets-5}

1.  Nu’n.By the Pen and what they write.<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-6"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup>

This is the earliest sura with a disconnected letter, or _muqattaʿat_. Like many of the early suras, it begins with an oath, in this case, “By the Pen”.

1.  You are not, by the Grace of your Rabb, mad.
2.  And indeed, of a certainty, there is for you an endless reward.
3.  And verily, you are of supreme character!
4.  So, you shall soon see, and they shall see,
5.  Which one of you is mad.
6.  Indeed, your Rabb is HeWho knows who it is that has wandered off His path,And He knows the rightly guided.

Already in this early sura we see God consoling the Prophet regarding accusations that he is demented. Perhaps the Prophet, at this early stage in his career, even doubted his own sanity. This consolation helps give him the strength to move forward.

## Catalog of Vices {#catalog-of-vices}

1.  So, do not follow those who deny the Truth.
2.  They would love to see you compromise (with them),So that they may compromise (with you).
3.  And follow not every worthless swearer,
4.  Slanderer vagabond, carrying tales,
5.  Thwarting the good, extreme in evil deeds,
6.  Stone hearted, and besides that, unscrupulous,
7.  (Just) because he has wealth and children.
8.  When Our Signs are recited to him, he says:“(These are) tales of the ancients!”
9.  Soon We shall smite him on his nose.

We see here a theme that is a continuation from the Hebrew prophets and even Jesus proclaiming themselves as different from those false prophets of their own time.

# Part II: Equal Opportunities {#part-ii-equal-opportunities}

Neuwirth describes this section as a “report with polemic introduction and eschatological conclusion, 18 verses, by peripeteia divided into 9 + 9”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-7"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-7">[7]</a></sup></sup>.

## Polemic Introduction {#polemic-introduction}

1.  Indeed, We have tested you as We tested the companions of the Garden,When they swore that they would assuredly reap the fruits in the morning.
2.  But they did not make an allowance (for the will of Allah).
3.  So there descended on them what was to descend, from their Rabb,While they were asleep.
4.  And by the morning, it (the orchard) was like a sand dune.
5.  And they called each other by the morning:
6.  “Go to your fields early in the morning, if you are to reap the harvest.”
7.  So they went and they whispered to each other:
8.  “This day no poor person shall come upon you (while you are) in them.”
9.  And they marched forth early in the morning, (feeling) powerful in their stinginess.

This polemic is reminiscent of Amos 8 in which that earlier prophet condemns the Israelites for violating their covenant with God by being stingy with the poor.

## Eschatological Conclusion {#eschatological-conclusion}

1.  But then, when they saw it, they said:“We are indeed lost!
2.  Nay! We are destitute!”
3.  One of the right minded ones among them said:“Did I not tell you: ‘Why do you not glorify (Allah)?’”
4.  They said: “Glorified be our Rabb!We were indeed transgressors!”
5.  Then they turned to one another, blaming.
6.  They said: “Woe is to us!We were indeed rebellious!
7.  There is hope that our RabbWill turn this into goodness for us;We do indeed turn to our Rabb.”
8.  That is how (Divine) punishment is!But the punishment of the hereafter is greater,If only they knew!
9.  Indeed, for those conscious of Allah,There are Gardens of bliss from their Rabb.

This recalls prophets like Isaiah who prophesied that the people would be destroyed due to their iniquity but that through that punishment they would reconnect with God. We see this theme today in which it is the people who are suffering who are most likely to turn to God, while those who are comfortable are less likely to pay attention to God or—relatedly—their obligation to the poor.

# Part III: Revelation Polemic {#part-iii-revelation-polemic}

This section of 18 ayat is likewise divided into two sections of 9.

## The Unbelievers {#the-unbelievers}

### Polemical questions to the unbelievers {#polemical-questions-to-the-unbelievers}

1.  Should We make those who surrender (to Allah)Like those who are culpable?
2.  What is it with you? How do you decide?
3.  Is there a Book with you that you read?
4.  Indeed, (is there) in it for you whatever you like?
5.  Or, do you have a contract with Us valid until the Judgment DayThat you shall have whatever you decide?
6.  Ask them who would be the responsible one for that?
7.  Or their associates?Then, let them bring their associates, if they are truthful.

This questioning is reminiscent of the רִיב or “covenant lawsuit” we see in several of the Hebrew prophets in which the people are called to stand trial for their violation of their covenant with God.

### يَوْمَ: Collapse of the unbelievers {#collapse-of-the-unbelievers}

1.  The Day when the veil shall be lifted from the shin bone,And they shall be called to prostrate,They shall not be able (to prostrate).
2.  There shall be fear in their eyes,Dishonor hovering over them.And verily they were called to prostrateWhile they were still sound (healthy and well).

Neuwirth calls this section يَوْمَ or “_yaum_” referring to the word for “the Day” (capitalized in translation) referring (presumably) to the Day of Judgment described in both this and in sura 67 (as well as many other places in the Qur’an). Following the tradition of the רִיב , the lawsuit concludes with a judgment or punishment (_cf._ Micah 6:9-16). However, following from Sura 67:11, quite unlike what we see in the Hebrew prophets, we do not see a promise of return to God for the unbelievers following their punishment. From a theological perspective, the Hebrew prophets might be seen as Restorationist. The Qur’an is less forgiving.

## Speak to the Messenger {#speak-to-the-messenger}

These last eight ayat return the attention to the prophet, mirroring the first eight ayat in this sura.

### Speak to the messenger about the deniers who reject revelation {#speak-to-the-messenger-about-the-deniers-who-reject-revelation}

1.  So leave it to Me;And whoever gives the lie to this admonition,We shall soon drag him in such slow measures that he does not perceive it.
2.  And I give them respite;Verily, My plan is firm!
3.  Is it that you ask from them a recompenseThat they are burdened with debt?
4.  Or is there hidden knowledge with them that they document?

This section reassures the prophet of the punishment due his detractors.

### Call for patience, comparison with Jonah {#call-for-patience-comparison-with-jonah}

1.  So be patient with the Command of your Rabb,And do not be like the companion of the fish (Jonah),When he cried out, and he was filled with grief.
2.  Verily, if he was not supported by the Grace of his Rabb,He would be thrown onto the open shore,And he would be humiliated.
3.  But his Rabb chose him,And made him among the righteous.

Again, connecting Muhammad to the prophetic tradition, God warns Muhammad not to be like the prophet Jonah. This passage is a little odd, however, because in spite of Jonah’s unfaithfulness, God still “chose him and made him among the righteous.”

### Confirmation of the Quran {#confirmation-of-the-quran}

1.  And verily, the disbelieversNearly make you lose your focus with their staresWhen they hear the Reminder,And they say: “Assuredly, he is mad.”
2.  Lo! This is but a Reminder for all the worlds.

Finally, confirming the Qur’an and encouraging Muhammad not to lose faith in the face of those who call him mad.
