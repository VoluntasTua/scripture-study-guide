## Introduction

Sura 56, known as _al-Wāqiʻah_, translated variously as "The Inevitable", "The Event", or "That Which Must Come to Pass",  takes its name from the first verse.

Like most suras, this one also consists of a tripartite structure which can be further subdivided.

\(I, 1– 56; **II, 57– 74**; III, 75– 96\) Notes: Not counting 56: 8 and 56: 9, as duplicates of 56: 27 and 56: 41; counting as two verses 56: 10 \(after wal-sabiqun, “and the forerunners”\), 56: 27 \(after al-yamin, “of the right”\), 56: 41 \(after al-shimal, “of the left”\); 56: 25– 26 probably go after 56: 40 Structure: 7 + 16 + 17 + 17, 18, 21 + 1
