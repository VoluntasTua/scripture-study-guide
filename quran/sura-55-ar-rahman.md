# Sura 55 - _ar-Raḥmān_

## Introduction

Sura 55, known as _ar-Rahman_, translated variously as the Most Gracious, the Benficent, and the Most Merciful,  takes its name from the first ayah. It is regarded by many as the crown of the Qur'an. It is unclear as to whether it is an earlier Meccan sura or a later Medinan one.[^1] Muhammad Asad remarks on "the opinion that it followed immediately upon _surah_ 13 \("Thunder"\) . . . which is not very helpful since that _surah_, too, cannot be assigned to either of the two periods with any degree of certainty."[^2]

This sura consists of a tripartite structure \(not counting 31 repetitions of the refrain\): 12, 14, 21 + 1[^3]. The first two parts are hymns and the third is an eschatology.[^4]

## I Hymn

Al-Ghazali considers this entire hymn \(verses 1-13 including the refrain\) among the jewels of divine knowledge.

### Hymnic Prelude: Revelation, Creation

The first four verses form a hymnic prelude, concerning revelation and creation. Dr. Nazeer Ahmed translates them thus:[^6]

> 1. The Most Compassionate,
> 2. Taught the Qur’an;
> 3. Created the human,
> 4. Taught him speech \(discourse, thought, logic, reason, comprehension, integration\).

In her lecture on “Late Antique Qur'an”, Angelika Neuwirth observed that this passage places the teaching of the Qur'an _before_ the creation of humanity.[^5] This recalls the opening of the Gospel of John:

> 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
> 2. He was in the beginning with God. 
> 3. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being 
> 4. in him was life,\[a\] and the life was the light of all people. 
> 5. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

In other words, the Qur'an is to be understood, in this context, as a celestial text, not to be confused with the physical manifestation of it in the voice of the prophet, much less the transcription of that voice into a physical book. This ambiguity around the word Qur'an can also be found in the Jewish and Hindu traditions regarding the words _Torah_ and _Veda_ respectively. That is, in all of these cases, there is a celestial text which exists more as an idea or even a template of creation, and then there is the physical book that refers to that text. While it is no accident that both the transcendent and the physical are referred to by the same name, they one should not be confused with the other. It might be akin to pointing to Asia on a map. The "Asia" on the map is not the real Asia, but a signifier. I can point to the signifier of Asia on a map and say, "that's Asia" without you thinking the actual continent is on that map. Similarly, the volume of the Qur'an that you hold in your hand can be considered a signifier of the true Qur'an that pre-exists creation.

### Hymnic Verse Pair

Dr. Nazeer Ahmed translates the next two verses thus:

> 5. The sun and the moon  
> \(Orbit\) with mathematical precision,
>
> 6. And the stars,  
> And the trees,  
> Bow down in prostration.

### Ayat \(Doubles\): 3 V. Heaven, 3 V. Earth

The later half of this hymn consists of a pair of three verses each describing heaven and earth respectively:

> 7. And the heavens has He raised high  
> And established \(dynamic\) equilibrium \(therein\),
>
> 8. So that you do not violate justice \(in your own lives\).
>
> 9. And establish weight with equity,  
> And do not compromise the balance.

> 10. And the earth has He shaped for the living creatures,
>
> 11. In it there are fruit,  
> And date palms, of \(many\) varieties with sheathed clusters;
>
> 12. And grains with husks and herbs with scent,

### Refrain

Finally, the refrain:

> 13. Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?

This refrain will repeat continuously throughout the rest of this sura. Nöldeke _et al_. find it "tiresome",[^7] and to be fair, it is rather repetitive. However, two things must be kept in mind:

1. The Qur'an is meant to be recited and the recitation itself is a prayerful act and the repetition of this refrain would have a meditative effect on both the reciter and on listeners. You can listen to this refrain \(and the whole sura\) at https://quran.com/55/13
2. This sura is arguably a countertext to Psalm 136 of the Judeo-Christian tradition.[^8] As such, we should consider how this verse compares to the refrain from that text: "for his steadfast love endures forever." \(which occurs in all 26 verses of that psalm\).

## II Hymn \(14 - 14-35\)

The second hymn consists of two parts containing 10 and 4 verses respectively. The first 10 describe the magnificence of God and are among the jewels of divine knowledge. The latter four describe the threats of Allah and thus are omitted from Al-Ghazalli's jewels.

### The Magnificence of God

The following ver

> 14. He has created the human from animated clay, \(malleable\) like that of pottery,  
> 15. And created the Jinn from turbulent fire,  
> 16.         Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
>
> 17. The Rabb of the two Easts \(inner in your souls and outer in nature\)  
> And of the two Wests \(inner and outer\).  
> 18.        Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
>
> 19. He has floated the two oceans that meet,  
> 20. Between them is a partition that they do not cross,  
> 21.        Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
>
> 22. From them are brought forth pearls and corals,  
> 23.        Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
>
> 24. And His are the ships that move on the oceans, \(rising high\) like mountains,  
> 25.        Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
>
> 26. Upon all that exists, there shall be annihilation,  
> 27. The Being of your Rabb, the Lord of Majesty and Bounty, shall endure,  
> 28.        Then, which of the bounties of your Rabb do you deny \(O humans and Jinns\)?
