Sura 55, known as _ar-Rahman_, translated variously as the Most Gracious, the Benficent, and the Most Merciful,  takes its name from the first ayah. It is regarded by many as the crown of the Qur'an. It is unclear as to whether it is an earlier Meccan sura or a later Medinan one.[^1] Muhammad Asad remarks on "the opinion that it followed immediately upon _surah_ 13 \("Thunder"\) . . . which is not very helpful since that _surah_, too, cannot be assigned to either of the two periods with any degree of certainty."[^2]
