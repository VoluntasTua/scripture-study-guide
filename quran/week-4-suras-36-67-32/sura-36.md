# Sura 36 - _Yāʾ-Sīn_

# يس

## Introduction

Sura 36 is one of 29 suras that begin with isolated letters or _muqaṭṭaʿāt_ and is one of four that are named after those letters \(along with _Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ_ \(20\), [_Ṣād_ \(38\)](/quran/week-3-suras-19-38/sura-38.md) and _Qāf_ \(50\)\). After the _Juz Amma_, that is, the last thirty-seven chapters of the Qur'an, \(most of which we covered in [week 1](/quran/sura-1.md)\), _Ya Sin_ is the most memorized chapter of the Qur'an.[^1] It is often recited for the benefit of the dead or dying people, chiefly because of the last six verses which speak to God's ability to resurrect the dead. In the words of Ibn Qayyim al-Ğawzīya, "\[t\]his sura is the heart of the Qur'an and something wonderful occurs when it is recited in the presence of a dying person."[^2]

The tripartite structure of this sura is thus: \(I, 1–12; II, 13–68; III, 69–83\)[^3]. The middle part can further be divided into three sections: 13-32, 33-47, 48-68.
