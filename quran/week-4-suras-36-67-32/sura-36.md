# Sura 36 - _Yāʾ-Sīn_

# يس

## Introduction

Sura 36 is one of 29 suras that begin with isolated letters or _muqaṭṭaʿāt_ and is one of four that are named after those letters \(along with _Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ_ \(20\), [_Ṣād_ \(38\)](/quran/week-3-suras-19-38/sura-38.md) and _Qāf_ \(50\)\). After the _Juz Amma_, that is, the last thirty-seven chapters of the Qur'an, \(most of which we covered in [week 1](/quran/sura-1.md)\), _Ya Sin_ is the most memorized chapter of the Qur'an.[^1]
