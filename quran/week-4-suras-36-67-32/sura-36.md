# Sura 36 - _Yāʾ-Sīn_

# يس

## Introduction

Sura 36 is one of 29 suras that begin with isolated letters or _muqaṭṭaʿāt_ and is one of four that are named after those letters \(along with _Ṭāʾ-Hāʾ_ \(20\), [_Ṣād_ \(38\)](/quran/week-3-suras-19-38/sura-38.md) and _Qāf_ \(50\)\). After the _Juz Amma_, that is, the last thirty-seven chapters of the Qur'an, \(most of which we covered in [week 1](/quran/sura-1.md)\), _Ya Sin_ is the most memorized chapter of the Qur'an.[^1] It is often recited for the benefit of the dead or dying people, chiefly because of the last six verses which speak to God's ability to resurrect the dead. In the words of Ibn Qayyim al-Ğawzīya, "\[t\]his sura is the heart of the Qur'an and something wonderful occurs when it is recited in the presence of a dying person."[^2]According to al-Ghazali, this sura has 25 jewels which can be found in the middle and at the end of the sura \(including the last six verses alluded to above\).

The tripartite structure of this sura is thus: \(I, 1–12; II, 13–68; III, 69–83\)[^3]. The introduction consists of a confirmation of revelation and a message regarding unbelievers. As with the prophets Moses \(Exodus 14:17\) and Isaiah \(Isaiah 6:10\), we see a message that it is God's will that some refuse to listen to the prophet's message.

The middle part can further be divided into three sections. Traditionally, these would be 13-32, 33-50, 51-67. Neuwirth divides them slightly differently: 13-32, 33-47, 48-68. Neuwirth[^4] titles the first of these with just a transliteration of the phrase مَثَلًا أَصْحَبَ الْقَرْيَةِ which translates literally as "an example \(of the\) companions \(of\) the city".[^5] She further posits that verse 46 belongs after verse 30. With that adjustment, the end of this section would read as follows \(using Dr. Nazeer Ahmed's translation[^6]\):

> 28: And, after this, We did not send down  
> An army on his people from the heavens,  
> Nor were We disposed to send down \(such an army\).
>
> 29: It was not but a single mighty blast,  
> And they were silenced \(as burnt ashes\)!
>
> 30: Alas for My servants!  
> There does not come any Messenger to them,  
> But they ridicule him.
>
> 46: And there has not come for them a Sign  
> From the Signs of their Rabb,  
> Except that they excuse themselves from it.
>
> 31: Have they not observed,  
> How many settlements \(civilizations\) We destroyed before them  
> So that they cannot return \(to their former status\).
>
> 32: And every one of them shall not but be presented before Us
