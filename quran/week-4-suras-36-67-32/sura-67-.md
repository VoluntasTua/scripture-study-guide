# Part I: Introduction: Hymn {#part-i-introduction-hymn}

The introduction to _al-Mulk_ consists of a hymn to the creator. These four ayat are the first 4 of 13 jewels identified by Al-Ghazzali in this sura.

Ingrid Mattson notes that this passage “states that God created death for a purpose . . . that death is a means God uses to motivate humanity toward greater spiritual refinement and to develop our moral potential.”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-2"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup>
