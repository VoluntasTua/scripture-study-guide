## A: Introduction (1-3) {#a-introduction-1-3}

_As-Sajdah_ is one of 29 surahs that begin with disconnected letters, or _muqattaʿat_. While the meaning of these letters, _Alif, Lam, Mim_, have not been definitively concluded, nearly all occurrences of these of the _muqattaʿat_ are followed by a reference to the _kitab_ or Book and surah 32 is no exception. The first three ayat are as follows (this and all following translations are by Dr. Nazeer Ahmed and can be found at [https://historyofislam.com/the-quran/surah-32-surah-as-sajda/](https://historyofislam.com/the-quran/surah-32-surah-as-sajda/) unless otherwise indicated):

1.  Alif-Lam-Meem
2.  The revelation of this BookIn which there is no ambiguityIs from the Rabb (Creator, Sustainer and Cherisher) of all the worlds.
3.  Do they say: “He has made it up?”No! This is the Truth from your Rabb,So that you warn a people,For whom no Warner has appeared before you,So that they receive guidance.

Neuwirth (2007) has titled this section _kitab_-Affirmation (pg. 305) which seems straightforward enough. In it, the prophet is affirming the legitimacy of the Book. What is not so straightforward is which book (_kitab_) is actually being referred to here. Perhaps the obvious answer would be the Qur’an itself. This seems doubtful however because the Prophet did not _write_ the Qur’an, he _recited_ it. Transcriptions of the Qur’an, or _mus’haf_, while certainly considered sacred, are secondary to the verbal recitation of the Qur’an (which, of course, literally means _recitation_).

For comparison, we also see the word _Kitab_ used in reference to _ahl al-Kitab_ or “the people of the Book”, referring to Jews, Christians, and Sabians (though it remains unclear just who the Sabians were). Thus we can see the word _Kitab_ as being somewhat synonymous with the Hebrew word _Torah_. Not the literal scroll however, but rather a more transcendent Word of God. It is worth noting that not only Judaism, but also Hinduism has this concept of a transcendent word of deity that is intentionally conflated with scripture (see _Veda and Torah_ by Barbara A. Holdrege for a detailed analysis). Islam would seem to fall into this category as well.

If so, then ayat 2 and 3 could be interpreted to say that the words of the Qur’an are a direct revelation of this transcendent _Kitab_ as transmitted through the Prophet.

## B. Sublime Allah (4-9) {#b-sublime-allah-4-9}

The next six verses are what Neuwirth calls the _Erhabenheit Allahs_ or “Sublime Allah” section of this sura. They are also the first six (of seven) Jewels of Divine Knowledge according to Al-Ghazzali. They are as follows:

1.  Allah is He Who has created the heavens and the earth,And what is in between them,In six measures of time,Then did He establish Himself on the Throne of authority.No protector do you have,Nor an intercessor,But Him.Will you not be among those who remember?
2.  He plans (all) the directed energies (actions)From the heavens to the earth.Then, they ascend to Him in a momentThe measure whereof is a thousand years of what you calculate.
3.  He is the Knower of what is beyond perception,And what is perceived,(And He is) the Mighty, the Merciful.
4.  He it is who endowed everything He has createdWith beauty and perfection,And originated the creation of man from dust.
5.  Then he made his genreFrom the essence (seed) of a worthless fluid.
6.  Then he shaped him (with proportion),And breathed into him of His Spirit,And made for him ears and eyes and hearts (feelings and emotions);Little thanks do you give (for these gifts)!

Neuwirth further subdivides this section into four parts, the first three consisting of one ayah each and the last consisting of the three final ayat in this section.

The first ayah in this section is in Neuwirth’s words, a _Hymnus auf Allah, den Schöpfer von Himmel und Erde_ or a “Hymn to Allah, the Creator of Heaven and Earth”. It is a reference to the first chapter of Genesis or _Bereshit_ which consists of what is known as the Priestly account of the creation (as opposed to the non-Priestly Yahwistic account in the second reading).

The declaration that there is no intercessor is significant coming out of the Abrahamic tradition as an important role of many of the prophets prior to Mohammed was as intercessor (Genesis 18:22-33; 1 Kings 17:17-23; _etc._) Whether the Qur’an is denying that aspect of the Abrahamic tradition or whether it is saying that that will no longer be the case on the of judgment (in other words acknowledging the role of intercessors in historical affairs, but not in the final judgment) is unclear.

The second ayah in this section (5), Neuwirth calls the Providence of Allah. It ends with the phrase “يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ” which is translated variously as “a Day the measure of which is a thousand years of your reckoning” (Ali) or “a day, the span of which had been a thousand years of what you number” (Bakhtiar) and so on. In other words, it illustrates the great difference of magnitude in the perception of time between the divine perspective and the human one.

The third ayah in this section (6), Neuwirth calls “all-knowing” or “omniscience”. It is reminiscent of such meditations on God’s omniscience as Psalm 139 in the Hebrew Bible.

Finally, ayat 7-9, Neuwirth calls “creator of man” or “humanity”. This passage is reminiscent, of the second non-Priestly account of creation in Genesis in which the “God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.” (Genesis 2:7) What is curious about this passage is the reference to “a worthless fluid” which is translated variously as “despised fluid” (Ali) or “despicable water” (Bakhtiar). Muhammad Asad, in _The Message of the Quran_ translates it as “a humble fluid”. Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi’s tafsir interprets this ayah as “In the beginning He created man directly by His own act of Creation, and- then placed in man himself such a procreative ability that similar men continue being produced by his sperm-drop.” Is the “worthless fluid” meant to denote semen? It’s certainly plausible, but not entirely clear.

These six ayat together are among the jewels of the Qur’an according to Al-Ghazzali. Muhammad Abul Quasem (1977) defines these jewels as “those verses which especially concern the essence of God, His attributes and His works.” (pg 88). There are 763 jewels in all, 7 in this sura, and this section is six of them.

In the next section, we will encounter the pearls of wisdom which includes the ayah that provides the title of this sura.
