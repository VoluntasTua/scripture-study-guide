## A: Introduction (1-3) {#a-introduction-1-3}

_As-Sajdah_ is one of 29 surahs that begin with disconnected letters, or _muqattaʿat_. While the meaning of these letters, _Alif, Lam, Mim_, have not been definitively concluded, nearly all occurrences of these of the _muqattaʿat_ are followed by a reference to the _kitab_ or Book and surah 32 is no exception. The first three ayat are as follows (this and all following translations are by Dr. Nazeer Ahmed and can be found at [https://historyofislam.com/the-quran/surah-32-surah-as-sajda/](https://historyofislam.com/the-quran/surah-32-surah-as-sajda/) unless otherwise indicated):

1.  Alif-Lam-Meem
2.  The revelation of this BookIn which there is no ambiguityIs from the Rabb (Creator, Sustainer and Cherisher) of all the worlds.
3.  Do they say: “He has made it up?”No! This is the Truth from your Rabb,So that you warn a people,For whom no Warner has appeared before you,So that they receive guidance.

Neuwirth (2007) has titled this section _kitab_-Affirmation (pg. 305) which seems straightforward enough. In it, the prophet is affirming the legitimacy of the Book. What is not so straightforward is which book (_kitab_) is actually being referred to here. Perhaps the obvious answer would be the Qur’an itself. This seems doubtful however because the Prophet did not _write_ the Qur’an, he _recited_ it. Transcriptions of the Qur’an, or _mus’haf_, while certainly considered sacred, are secondary to the verbal recitation of the Qur’an (which, of course, literally means _recitation_).

For comparison, we also see the word _Kitab_ used in reference to _ahl al-Kitab_ or “the people of the Book”, referring to Jews, Christians, and Sabians (though it remains unclear just who the Sabians were). Thus we can see the word _Kitab_ as being somewhat synonymous with the Hebrew word _Torah_. Not the literal scroll however, but rather a more transcendent Word of God. It is worth noting that not only Judaism, but also Hinduism has this concept of a transcendent word of deity that is intentionally conflated with scripture (see _Veda and Torah_ by Barbara A. Holdrege for a detailed analysis). Islam would seem to fall into this category as well.

If so, then ayat 2 and 3 could be interpreted to say that the words of the Qur’an are a direct revelation of this transcendent _Kitab_ as transmitted through the Prophet.
