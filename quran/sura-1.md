## Week 1: Suras 1, 81-114

This week's scripture is taken directly from Michael Sells' _Approaching the Qur'an: The Early Revelations_. This book is highly recommended as an introduction to the Qur'an. Though he translates only a small portion of the Qur'an in that book \(the portion we are reading this week\), he introduces us to many of the most important dimensions to appreciating the Qur'an, especially it's musicality, which is virtually impossible to translate.
