# Sura 19 - _Maryam_

# مريم

## Introduction

This sura is unusual in that it divides into two parts, as opposed to the usual three. The first part \(which contains 2/3 of the sura\) does, however, consist of the usual tripartite structure, in this case of 14 + 25 + 25 \(not counting the _muqaṭṭaʿāt_ in the first ayah\).

## Zechariah and Mary

The first two sections of the sura concern Zechariah \(father of John the Baptist\) and Mary \(mother of Jesus\) respectively. It is a retelling of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Luke. It relates the account of two miraculous conceptions. In the first, Zechariah's wife is barren. This recalls the barrenness of Abra\(ha\)m's wife Sarah \(_cf._ Genesis 15:3 and Sura 51:29-30\) as well as many other such stories from the Hebrew tradition \(Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah, and so on\). In the second,  Mary is but a virgin \(v. 20, _cf._ Luke 1:34\). In the Christian tradition, this is interpreted as fulfillment of the prophesy of Isaiah \(7:14, \_cf. \_Matt 1:22\) though a more accurate translation of Isaiah is not "virgin" but "young woman". Nonetheless, the virgin birth of Jesus is of great significance to Christians and Muslims alike.

This section ends with an admonition not to mistake the nature of Jesus, either as God \(as the Christians do\) or as a false prophet \(as the Jews do\). Ghazali considers these two verses to be pearls:[^2]

> 39: And warn them of the Day of Wistfulness \(the Day of Sighing\),  
> When the matter will be decided.  
> But they are in a stupor,  
> And they do not believe.
>
> 40: Verily, We shall inherit the earth  
> And what is upon it,  
> And they shall be returned to Us.

## Abraham and other Prophets

The middle of the sura—the last part of the first section—verses 41-65, contains accounts of prophets knowns from the [Torah](/torah.md). The longest section \(vv. 41-50\) describes Abraham's relationship with his father. This, along with the polemic at the end against the Christian belief that Jesus is the literal son of God \(v. 89\) has been identified by Asma Barlas \(2002\) as "necessarily a conflict between monotheism and patriarchy \(in its traditional sense\)."[^1] In other words, the relationship between the child and the father is emphatically _not_ like the relationship between a Muslim and God. This is quite distinct from the Judeo-Christian metaphor of God-as-Father which occurs in both Hebrew and Christian scripture.

Verses 56 and 57 refer to a prophet named Idris. Asad \(2003\)[^3] has this to say about this prophet:

> The majority of the classical commentators identify the Prophet Idris . . . with the Biblical Enoch \(Genesis v. 18-19 and 21-24\), withouth, however, being able to adduce any authority for this purely conjectural identification. Some modern Aur'an-commentators suggest that the name Idris may be the Arabacized form of Osiris . . . but this assumption is too far-fetched to deserve any serious consideration. Finally, some of the earliest Qur'an-commentators \[assert\] that "Idris" is but another name for Ilyas, the Biblical Elijah.

Towards the end of the section are the pearls that Neuwirth describes the "reward of the pious":[^4]

> 58: These are among the Prophets from the progeny of Adam  
> Upon whom Allah bestowed His benevolence;  
> \(They were\) from those We carried with Noah,  
> And \(they were\) from the children of Abraham and Israel,  
> And \(they were\) among those We guided and selected;  
> When the Signs of the All Compassionate were revealed to them,  
> They would fall down in prostration and cry.
>
> 59: There came inheritors after them who inherited \(the legacies\),  
> They forgot the prayers and followed their base desires.  
> Soon shall they meet up with their destiny;
>
> 60: Except such as those who repent,  
> And have certainty of faith,  
> And engage in righteous deeds;  
> In that case, they shall enter the Garden,  
> And, not the least excess shall they be subjected to.
