# The Qur'an - Meccan Suras

This month we will be focusing on the portion of the Qur'an associated with the Meccan period of Muhammed's prophetic career, prior to the Hijra in 622 C.E. These suras tend to be shorter, more poetic, and more mystical than the later Medinan suras which are focused more on how to govern the community of believers in Medina after the Hijra. Many of these suras, especially the ones composed in the first Meccan period, often have a Psalmic quality. For example, Sura 55 bears a certain resemblance to Psalm 136, prompting some \(most notably Angelika Neuwirth\) to suggest that it is in fact a "counter-text" or response to Psalm 136, which would surely have been known to the Muhammad and the Arabs of his time.

In the first two weeks we will cover many of the early Meccan suras. In the latter two weeks, we will consider five of the middle and later Meccan suras.

### [Week 1: Suras 1, 81-114](/quran/sura-1.md)

We begin with the first sura, the Opening. We then jump toward the end of the book. Though this covers 35 of the 114 suras by count, it is less than 3% of the overall text.

### [Week 2: Suras 53, 55, 56, 68](/quran/week-2-suras-53-55-56-68.md)

We proceed then to some of the longer \(relatively speaking\) of the early Meccan suras including sura 53 \(the Star\) and 55 \(the Compassionate\) two of the most well known suras in the Qur'an.

### [Week 3: Suras 19, 38](/quran/week-3-suras-19-38.md)

We now get to the so-called middle Meccan suras which are longer and therefore tend to have a more complex tripartite structure.

### [Week 4: Suras 32, 36, 67](/quran/week-4-suras-36-67-32.md)

Suras 32, 36, and 67 come from the mid-to-late Meccan period.
