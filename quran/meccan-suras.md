# The Qur'an - Meccan Suras

This month we will be focusing on the portion of the Qur'an associated with the Meccan period of Muhammed's prophetic career, prior to the Hijra in 622 C.E. These suras tend to be shorter, more poetic, and more mystical than the later Medinan suras which are focused more on how to govern the community of believers in Medina after the Hijra. Many of these suras, especially the ones composed in the first Meccan period, often have a Psalmic quality. For example, Sura 55 bears a certain resemblance to Psalm 136, prompting some \(most notably Angelika Neuwirth\) to suggest that it is in fact a "counter-text" or response to Psalm 136, which would surely have been known to the Muhammad and the Arabs of his time.

In the first two weeks we will cover many of the early Meccan suras. In the latter two weeks, we will consider five of the middle and later Meccan suras.
