# Part I: Introduction: Hymn {#part-i-introduction-hymn}

The introduction to _al-Mulk_ consists of a hymn to the creator. These four ayat are the first 4 of 13 jewels identified by Al-Ghazzali in this sura.

Ingrid Mattson notes that this passage “states that God created death for a purpose . . . that death is a means God uses to motivate humanity toward greater spiritual refinement and to develop our moral potential.”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-2"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-2">[2]</a></sup></sup>

# Part II {#part-ii}

## A: Security of the sky; Eschatological double image (5 – 12) {#a-security-of-the-sky-eschatological-double-image-5-12}

The first ayah in this section stands alone and is one of the jewels identified by Al-Ghazzali. It describes the means by which heaven is protected from evil ones by means of the light emitted by celestial lamps. The imagery is vivid but strange, and translations vary significantly. It is, in this way, a little reminiscent of the apocalyptic imagery in Ezekiel.

## B: Allah&#039;s omniscience and omnipotence (13 – 22) {#b-allah-s-omniscience-and-omnipotence-13-22}

The first three ayat of this section (vv. 13-15) contain the 7th, 8th, and 9th jewel in this sura. Ayat 13 and 14 proclaim Allah’s omniscience. Ayah 15 recapitulates what we see at the end of the first chapter of Genesis (vv. 28-30) in which the creator “has made the earth subject to” humanity. In other words, this sura about God’s dominion relegates one part of creation to another, effectively making humanity God’s viceroy over the Earth.

Ayah 19 describes Allah’s work in nature by way of the example of birds being held aloft. It proclaims the miracle of flight to be God’s work. While we now know the physical mechanism by which birds fly, it is nonetheless a wonder to behold such that even a naturalist like me can be awed by the miracle of creation. Any scientist must agree with the Qur’an that the greatest miracle of all is the universe itself.

# Part III: Polemic about revival {#part-iii-polemic-about-revival}

Most of the ayat in this section (including the four jewels) begin with “قُلْ” or “Say:” which recalls the beginning of sura 112: “Say: He is God …”. The first two (vv. 23-24) begin with “قُلْ هُوَ الَّذِي” which translates as “Say: He is the one who …” They call the listener to be grateful for the senses which have been endowed by the creator. Meditation on the senses (including “وَالْأَفْئِدَةَ” which, like the concept of “心” in Chinese, refers to both feeling and thinking) is a common practice among contemplatives.

Neuwirth posits that the last two ayat in this sura should be reversed. Al-Ghazzali considers ayat 29 and 30 to be the last two jewels in this sura. All three begin with “قُلْ” or “Say:” While I do not know Neuwirth’s reasoning for transposing ayat 29 and 30, I agree that 30 does thematically connect with 28 as “polemical questions regarding possible disasters”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-3"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-3">[3]</a></sup></sup> while ayah 29, which consists of a creed in itself, is a fitting conclusion to the sura.
