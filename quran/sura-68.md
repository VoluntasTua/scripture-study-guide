Sura 68, known as _al-Qalam_, translated as the Pen, takes its name from the first ayah. It is one of the earliest suras. Some consider it to be the second sura received after 96 (widely considered to be the first sura). Nöldeke places it a bit later, but still clearly in the earliest Meccan period. Javed Ahmed Ghamidi posits that, in spite of the fact that they were composed at different times, suras 67 and 68 compose a unit concerning “يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ”, the Day of Judgment or Resurrection. He argues, “Just as in the previous sūrah the Quraysh are warned of the punishment of the Day of Judgement and of the punishment which they will face in this world if they deny the punishment of the Day of Judgement, similar is the warning sounded in this sūrah. However, this sūrah is more stern in its tone.”<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-4"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-4">[4]</a></sup></sup> Perhaps it is not surprising that in a sura with this “more stern” tone, Al-Ghazzali did not find any jewels or pearls.

## Sworn Passages {#sworn-passages}

1.  Nu’n.By the Pen and what they write.<sup><sup id="565915100367062-footnote-ref-6"><a href="#565915100367062-footnote-6">[6]</a></sup></sup>

This is the earliest sura with a disconnected letter, or _muqattaʿat_. Like many of the early suras, it begins with an oath, in this case, “By the Pen”.

1.  You are not, by the Grace of your Rabb, mad.
2.  And indeed, of a certainty, there is for you an endless reward.
3.  And verily, you are of supreme character!
4.  So, you shall soon see, and they shall see,
5.  Which one of you is mad.
6.  Indeed, your Rabb is HeWho knows who it is that has wandered off His path,And He knows the rightly guided.

Already in this early sura we see God consoling the Prophet regarding accusations that he is demented. Perhaps the Prophet, at this early stage in his career, even doubted his own sanity. This consolation helps give him the strength to move forward.

## Catalog of Vices {#catalog-of-vices}

1.  So, do not follow those who deny the Truth.
2.  They would love to see you compromise (with them),So that they may compromise (with you).
3.  And follow not every worthless swearer,
4.  Slanderer vagabond, carrying tales,
5.  Thwarting the good, extreme in evil deeds,
6.  Stone hearted, and besides that, unscrupulous,
7.  (Just) because he has wealth and children.
8.  When Our Signs are recited to him, he says:“(These are) tales of the ancients!”
9.  Soon We shall smite him on his nose.

We see here a theme that is a continuation from the Hebrew prophets and even Jesus proclaiming themselves as different from those false prophets of their own time.
