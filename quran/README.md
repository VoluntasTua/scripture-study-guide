Some background: the 114 chapters, or suras \(literally, "enclosures"\) of the Qur'an were received over the course of 23 years. It's worth noting at the outset that the arrangement of the suras in the Qur'an is _not_ chronological. The arrangement seems to be based on several criteria, most notably, from longest to shortest \(with some exceptions\). The first exception is the first sura, the opening, which is considered by some to be the Muslim equivalent to the Lord's Prayer \(a.k.a. the "Our Father"\). It is a common prayer among Muslims. The second sura, then, is the longest, and arguably the most difficult. Thus, many Westerners, wishing to learn more about Islam, make the mistake of trying to read the Qur'an from cover to cover and are quickly overwhelmed and confused. This is not—it should be said—how Muslims approach the Qur'an in their lifetime. While a Muslim may recite the Qur'an from start to finish during the month of Ramadan, this is not how students of the Qur'an begin their studies. Rather, they begin at the end, with the shorter Meccan suras, as will we.

The majority of the suras \(by count\) were received in the first 13 years when the Prophet Mohammed was still living in Mecca. These are commonly referred to as the Meccan suras. They tend to be shorter and more poetic. This period has been further subdivided into "early" and "late" or even more finely into "first", "second", and "third" Meccan period.

In 622 CE, it became too dangerous for Mohammed and his community of Muslims to stay in Mecca, so they emigrated to Yathrib, later known as Medina. This is known as the Hijra and is the beginning of the Muslim calendar. the last 24 suras were received after this emigration. They tend to be much longer and focus more on legal and social matters as Mohammed was establishing political and military control of the area. Though they are only two dozen of them, they account for nearly half of the total volume.
