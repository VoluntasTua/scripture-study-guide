# Sura 64 - _at-Taghābun_

# التغابن

Sura 64, known as _at-Taghābun_, translated as "Loss and Gain" or alternatively "Loss, Deprivation",  takes its name from the ninth verse, in the center of the sura. It is generally associated with the Medina period. It is one of the _Al-Musabbihat_ suras, according to Mufti Muhammad Shafi, that begin with Allah's glorification, along with _Al-Ḥadīd_ \(57\) الحديد, _Al-Ḥashr_ \(59\) الحشر, _Aṣ-Ṣaff_ \(61\) الصف, and _Al-Jumu\`ah_ \(62\) الجمعة, and sometimes _Al-Isrāʼ_ \(17\) الإسراء and _Al-Aʻlā_ \(87\) الأعلى.

Like most suras, this one also consists of a tripartite structure. The first part consists of four verses addressed to all people. These are the jewels of this sura. The middle part, consisting of six verses, is addressed to those who do not believe in the Qur'an. Finally, the last part, consisting of eight verses, are instructions to those who accept the Qur'an, and are the pearls of this sura.
