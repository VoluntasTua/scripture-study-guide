# Surah 24.an-Nūr\(The Light\)

## Structure of the Surah

As this is one of the Medinan surahs, we do not have the benefit of Neuwirth’s analysis. We begin with the observation that the surah is 64 \(or 26\) ayat, canonically divided into 9 sections. We can cluster these into a tripartite structure as such:

1. Punishment for adultery \(10 verses\), admonition against slander \(10 verses\) and bearing false witness \(6 verses\)

\(1-10\) …The one who is an adulteress and the one who is an adulterer, scourge each of them one hundred strokes.…  
\(11-20\) Indeed, those who brought an enormous slander are a group among you  
\(21-26\) …Truly, those who accuses the ones who are free, unwary, chaste female believers were cursed in the present and the world to come…

1. Regarding privacy \(8 verses\); the Light verse \(6 verses\); the creation of the Universe \(10 verses\)  
   \(27-34\) …Enter not houses other than your houses until you announced your presence…  
   \(35-40\) Godisthe Light of the heavens and the earth.…  
   \(41-50\) …God turns around and around the nighttime and the daytime.…

2. Obedience to God \(7 verses\), modesty \(4 verses\) and a warning \(3 verses\)  
   \(51-57\) …say: We heard and obeyed.…  
   \(58-61\) …These arethe three times of privacy for you.…  
   \(62-64\) …Surely, He knows what you did. And on the Day when they are returned to Him, then, He will tell them what their hands did, and GodisKnowing of everything.

While all of the suras could be said to be, in a way, holographic of the whole Qur’an, I find that particularly to be the case with this, one of the last surahs received/composed. It is also a sura that is both particularly amenable to the ring-structure interpretation and yet quite prone to misinterpretation if one fails to recognize that structure.

In the contemporary Western world, we tend to organize our compositions such a way that the focus of the piece is at the beginning and then reiterated at the end; in other words, the exact opposite of the ring structure we encounter in the Qur’an. Such a Western reading would lead one to believe that the focus of this surah is on adultery \(in which, the title of the surah, indeed, would seem arbitrary\). Without a doubt, the issue of adultery was certainly at the top of the Prophet’s mind at a time when members of his own community were accusing his wife of just that. One could cynically interpret the beginning of this surah in much the same way that one hears politicians who boast about being “tough on crime.” Perhaps Muhammed is reassuring his audience that he does not take the issue of adultery lightly.

As we move through the surah, each topic gives way to the next which—unlike in Western journalism—should not be interpreted assubordinate, but rather assuperordinate. That is, the second section trumps \(though does not abrogate\) the first. By the end of the first section, the surah has already started to move the focus from the adulterer to the accuser and in the second section, the surah elaborates on the necessity of being skeptical of gossip, especially of known gossipers. This theme is elaborated further in the third section.

I imagine Muhammad saying, “yes, adultery is a serious crime, so serious, in fact, that it is deserving of a hundred lashes,” \(though, notably, not of being stoned to death as it says in the Torah\). He goes on to say, “but let’s talk about the real issue here: the fact that you are gossiping and spreading rumors about adultery.”

I struggled with whether to put section 4 into part I or II. At first I put it in part I so as to keep the focus of part II on the Light verse, but then I realized that, in keeping with the ring structure, the Light verse should be at the heart of it’s own section. Besides, section 4 represents a major shift away from the topic of adultery and bearing false witness and turns instead to the image of the house and of privacy within it. Section 4 also contains one of the two verses cited by Asma Barlas as being used to justify forcing Muslim women to wear thehijabor even theburqa, which I will return to in the section below.

Section 5, which is both the heart of the middle section and the heart of the surah as a whole, begins with the famous light verse:

Godisthe Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Lightisas a niche in which thereisa lamp. The lampisin a glass. The glassisas if it had been a glittering star, kindled from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil of oliveisabout to illuminate although no fire touches it. Light on light, God guides to His Light whom He wills! And God propounds parables for humanity, and GodisKnowing of everything.

\(24:35\)

Whether this is merely a beautiful description of God, or whether it has esoteric meaning, I will let Sufis decide \(though it certainly lends itself easily to esoteric interpretation\). The image of the Light is elaborated throughout this section. In verse 36, the Light is explicitly depicted as being “in houses” \( فِي بُيُوتٍ \), bringing back the imagery of the house described in the previous section.

Section 6 shifts from the metaphor of God as Light to an elaboration of God as Creator. Ernst says that the “description of the signs of God in nature” is “is considerably reduced” in the Medinan surahs compared to the Meccan surahs, though this section would appear to be an exception to that rule. The imagery of “how God propels cloudsand, again, brings what is between them together” \(24:43\) evokes the same naturalistic imagery we saw in the rider oath at the beginning of surah 51 above.

Section 7 shifts the attention back to the muslim. In fact, the command, “to say: We heard and obeyed” \(24:51\) could be taken as the very definition of a muslim. The definition is elaborated in the next verse saying “whoever obeys God and His Messenger and dreads God and is Godfearing, those, they are the ones who are victorious.” We are now leaving the transcendence of the middle part of surah 24 and are moving back towards temporal matters, namely, the war. This section ends with a warning to “those who were ungratefulthattheyareones who will frustrateHimin the region. Their place of shelterwill bethe fire and how miserable the Homecoming!”

Section 8, like section 4, is focused on more domestic matters, on privacy and on modesty. Section 9 would seem to assert the dominance of “God and His Messenger” over the “ones who believe”, reinforcing the message in section 7 but in an again more immanent manner.

This gives us three parts with three sections each, and each part—with its three sections—can be seen as a ring unto itself. The first part centers on section 2 which focuses on the importance of not gossiping and spreading false rumors. Section 1 can be seen as the motivation for section 2 and section 3 primarily reinforces it.

The importance of building a community that does not gossip is not just a matter of building a just and stable community \(though that is certainly important\), but it is also and importantly to make space for the experience of God described in section 5. While the first part is largely about making psychic space for that experience \(by clearing the mind of having to manage false accusations\) section 4 is focused on it in a more literal sense. It says not to enter someone’s house without permission. Among other things: they could be praying! Section 6 reinforces section 5 but adds the dimension of time.

Section 8, being the heart of the third part, focuses again on modesty and privacy, necessary for a pious mind. Sections 7 and 9 stress the importance of submission.

## Feminist Readings

Barlas did a good job of contextualizing 24:31 to the point where she correctly points out that the admonition for modesty among women is applied as well to men in the verse immediately preceding it. It could be argued that the verse on women is quite a bit longer than the verse on men, but that does not in itself make it misogynistic. Unfortunately, in focusing on the feminist issue in this surah, she neglected to identify why modesty is an issue in the first place. That is, the focus of this surah is no more on the woman’s scarf than it is on the issue of adultery. The focus of this surah is on experiencing the Light of God.
