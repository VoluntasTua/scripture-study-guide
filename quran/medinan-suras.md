# The Qur'an - Medinan Suras

This month we will be focusing on the portion of the Qur'an associated with the Muhammad's time in Medina, after the Hijra. These suras are much longer than the earlier Meccan suras. At this time in Muhammad's career, he was building the Islamic community. As such, these suras tend to be much more focused on practical matters. For a biblical corrolary, they are more like the book of Leviticus.

In these suras, we more of a dialogue with the Jews and Christians in Yathrib/Medina. These suras, especially 2-5, are very long compared to the Meccan suras and as such we will be focusing only on particular portions of those suras. Sura 24 is short enough to be read in one sitting.

In choosing which verses to focus on for suras 2, 4, and 5, I followed two criteria: First, I made sure to include all of the passages references in Barbara Hampton's [_Reading Scripture Together: A Comparative Qur'an and Bible Study Guide_](https://muslimandchristiandialogue.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/reading_scripture_together_preview.pdf).
