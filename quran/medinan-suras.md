# The Qur'an - Medinan Suras

This month we will be focusing on the portion of the Qur'an associated with the Muhammad's time in Medina, after the Hijra. These suras are much longer than the earlier Meccan suras. At this time in Muhammad's career, he was building the Islamic community. As such, these suras tend to be much more focused on practical matters. For a biblical corrolary, they are more like the book of Leviticus.

In these suras, we more of a dialogue with the Jews and Christians in Yathrib/Medina. These suras, especially 2-5, are very long compared to the Meccan suras and as such we will be focusing only on particular portions of those suras. Sura 24 is short enough to be read in one sitting.

In choosing which verses to focus on for suras 2, 4, and 5, I followed two criteria: First, I made sure to include all of the passages references in Barbara Hampton's [_Reading Scripture Together: A Comparative Qur'an and Bible Study Guide_](https://muslimandchristiandialogue.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/reading_scripture_together_preview.pdf). \(The other half of that dialogue will be covered in the [Torah](/torah.md) and [Gospel](/gospels-.md) modules of this course.\) While Hampton is coming from a distinctly Evangelical Christian point of view, her choices of passages for comparison between the Meccan Suras and the Christian Bible are helpful when coming from a dominantly Christian cultural paradigm. Thus, we will see references to familiar Biblical figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus but from a distinctly Muslim point of view.

Second, I drew upon al-Ghazali's [_Jewels of the Qur'an_](http://www.muslimsupport.net/download/books/Jewels of the Quran.pdf) \(translated by Muhammad Abul Quasem, 1977\).  Recall from [the introduction to the Qur'an](/quran/README.md), that al-Ghazali identified particular verses in the Qur'an as jewels and pearls. I made sure to include all of these verses in my selections for these suras. 

Beyond those two criteria, I simply included verses to fill in the smaller gaps for the sake of continuity.
