# The Qur'an - Medinan Suras

This month we will be focusing on the portion of the Qur'an associated with the Muhammad's time in Medina, after the Hijra. These suras are much longer than the earlier Meccan suras. At this time in Muhammad's career, he was building the Islamic community. As such, these suras tend to be much more focused on practical matters. For a biblical corrolary, they are more like the book of Leviticus.

In these suras, we more of a dialogue with the Jews and Christians in Yathrib/Medina. These suras, especially 2-5, are very long compared to the Meccan suras and as such we will be focusing only on particular portions of those suras. Sura 24 is short enough to be read in one sitting.

In choosing which verses to focus on for suras 2, 4, and 5, I followed two criteria: First, I made sure to include all of the passages references in Barbara Hampton's [_Reading Scripture Together: A Comparative Qur'an and Bible Study Guide_](https://muslimandchristiandialogue.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/reading_scripture_together_preview.pdf). \(The other half of that dialogue will be covered in the [Torah](/torah.md) and [Gospel](/gospels-.md) modules of this course.\) While Hampton is coming from a distinctly Evangelical Christian point of view, her choices of passages for comparison between the Meccan Suras and the Christian Bible are helpful when coming from a dominantly Christian cultural paradigm. Thus, we will see references to familiar Biblical figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus but from a distinctly Muslim point of view.

Second, I drew upon al-Ghazali's [_Jewels of the Qur'an_](http://www.muslimsupport.net/download/books/Jewels of the Quran.pdf) \(translated by Muhammad Abul Quasem, 1977\).  Recall from [the introduction to the Qur'an](/quran/README.md), that al-Ghazali identified particular verses in the Qur'an as jewels and pearls. I made sure to include all of these verses in my selections for these suras.

Beyond those two criteria, I simply included verses to fill in the smaller gaps for the sake of continuity.

## [Week 1: Sura 2](/quran/week-1-sura-2.md)

This sura is easily the longest sura in the Qur'an. It contains 286 verses, several of which are longer than many of the earliest suras altogether. \(For example, verse 2:281 is the length of the entirety of [sura 89](/quran/sura-1.md).\) We will be focusing on the following five sections: verses 1-5, 140-177, 190-196, 255-262, and 285-286.

## [Week 2: Sura 4](/quran/week-2-sura-4.md)

For this sura we will focus on one largish section followed by many smaller passages. We will begin with the first verse, and then skip to verses 13-40 which Hampton compares to Luke 15:11-31. We will then consider verses 48, 49, 58, 59, 64-70, 79-87, 94-96, 103-116, 125-129, 146-149, 153-162, and finally 171-176.

## [Week 3: Sura 5](/quran/week-3-sura-5.md)

For this sura, we will begin with the opening, verses 1-3, followed by an isolated verse: 17, followed by two larger sections: 35-50 and 72-120. Verses 72-120 contain a dialogue between Allah and Jesus which illuminates how Muslims perceive trinitarian Christianity.

In addition to Suras 2, 4, and 5, Hampton also cites 7:157-158 and 16:102 as being particularly relevant to Christian-Muslim dialogue.

## [Week 4: Sura 24](/quran/sura-24.md)

We conclude with Sura 24, _an-NÅ«r_, or "the Light". It is one of the shorter Medinan suras and thus can be read in a single sitting.
