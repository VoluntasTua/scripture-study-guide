# Scripture Study Guide

## Introduction

This gitbook is a guide through a portion of the world's scriptures. Half of it is devoted to the Abrahamic tradition \(including Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scripture\) and half is devoted to the major religious traditions of East Asia \(including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism\). Scripture was chosen according to two criteria:

1. their influence on the world-at-large 
2. their relevance to contemporary secular North Americans \(especially Unitarian Universalists and "_None_"s\) 

All of these texts come originated on the Asian continent over 1000 years ago.

It is worth noting that while studying these texts will give us some insight into several of the world's scripture-based religions, this is _not_ an introduction to the world's religions. For one thing, there are many religions that are not scripture-based which are not represented here \(namely, every religion that originated on a continent other than Asia and many Asian religions as well\). For another, even when a religion is scripture-based, we should not overestimate the role that scripture plays in the practice of a religion. Scripture is not a manual for religion. Even scripture that purports to be a manual \(such as the book of Leviticus, many of the Confucian texts, and several Medinan Suras\), they must be interpreted liberally in order to be relevant to the 21st century. As we go through these books we will keep in mind two questions:

1. What does this mean to the people who regard it as sacred text?
2. What can this mean to me?

The answer to these two questions are often not the same and it is worth it to keep that in mind. It is also worth remembering that the first question is not really one question at all, but millions of questions, as each Christian, each Muslim, each Buddhist will interpret their sacred text differently. Christians and Jews share a holy text and yet interpret it differently. Within Judaism, reform and orthodox interpret it differently, and so on down to the individual. Thus, we cannot hope to answer the first question definitively \(and I hope, even the answer to the second will evolve over time\). However, we can hope to interpret the text in a way that is respectful of the tradition from which it comes.

This course is intended for people who may not have much experience with a religious or spiritual approach to a text. Instead, many of us are accustomed to a more critical and academic \(or even scientific\) approach to the written word. It is easy to criticize these texts. Much ink has been spent on just such a thing, and such an exercise can be valuable to a point. However, our approach here is different. In this course, we should try to read the text generously, not to critique but to allow in, to draw wisdom from.

At the same time, we should not be afraid of texts that we disagree or take issue with. Much of what we read may be offensive. It is worth acknowledging that and then looking to see what wisdom can be found there anyway. In my personal experience, I will say that I've often gotten the most out of scripture that I have had to struggle with. This does not mean accepting such scripture as the literal word of the creator. But it does mean taking it seriously and reading it generously. In some cases the interpretation that works for you may take years to arrive at and/or may not be compatible with the traditional interpretation. That's fine so long as we remain tolerant of traditional interpretations.

## Outline

This course is divided into 13 modules, each of which are intended to be taken over 4 weeks. Each module can be taken at any time. This way they can be arranged to align with holidays and so that people can join the course throughout the year.

### Abrahamic Scripture

Six modules focus on the Abrahamic traditions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

#### Torah or **Pentateuch**

#### [Nevi'im \(נְבִיאִים‎\) or Prophets](/prophets/README.md)

#### Ketuvim or Writings

#### Gospels

#### [Qur'an \(القرآن‎‎\) - Meccan Suras](/quran/meccan-suras.md)

#### [Qur'an \(القرآن‎‎\) - Medinan Suras](/quran/medinan-suras.md)

### East Asian Sutras

Six modules focus on East Asian traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism.

#### Vedas

#### Upanishads

#### Theravada Suttas

#### Mahayana Sutras

#### Confucian Classics

#### Taoist Scripture

### Other Scriptures

Every year we will try to cover one or more texts deemed sacred from a tradition other than those listed above. These might include sacred texts that originated outside the Asian continent \(such as Africa, Europe, or the Americas\), texts that are less than 1000 years old \(such as the Book of Mormon or the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\), or texts of other minority religions not represented above \(such as Zoroastrianism\).

## On Your Own

Every month, we will meet in person to discuss the text\(s\) we have been reading over the last four weeks. Each participant should bring a passage of about a dozen lines or so that you find particularly speaks to you. It could be from one of the assigned portions, or from something else related. Be prepared to read it and to speak a bit about why it spoke to you. Remember, this is not a forum for textual criticism but a space for religious contemplation.  

## On Translation

Needless to say, most of us must approach most \(if not all\) of these texts in translation. So then the question arises: which translation to use? There is no definitive answer to this question. The short answer is: several. Some translations are objectively better than others, but no translation is perfect. Each translation is, to a certain extent, an interpretation. For the purposes of this course, I will prefer translations that are freely available online though I may make recommendations for translations that I particularly like even if they are not free.

## On Commentary

Some like to say that you should read scripture without commentary, that you should let it stand on its own and speak with its own voice. Taken to it's extreme, this is terrible advice. Those who promote this point of view are typically deeply steeped in their own religious tradition and dramatically underestimate the amount of tacit knowledge they have about their own scripture. For someone who grew up hearing about the stories of the Buddha, or Jesus, or Muhammad, perhaps commentary is unnecessary.

On the other hand, too much commentary can also be a distraction. Academics often fall to the other extreme, taking on so many other points of view that the text itself gets crowded out by a sea of voices leaving no space for the reader to have her own experience of the text.

In this guide, I try to strike a balance between the two. I try to give enough context to render the text comprehensible, but not so much as to be distracting. I rarely provide interpretations except where I think that they are particularly interesting, and even there, only tentatively. Ultimately, the meaning of the text lies with the reader. Other writers can only provide hints.
